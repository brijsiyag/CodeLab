You should probably think of them as two separate problems.You are given an integer array a[1 ....... n] = [a_1, a_2, ......., a_n].Let us consider an empty deque (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [olor{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, olor{red}{1}].The elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.For example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: \\quad 1.add 3 to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence [olor{red}{3}] in it;\\quad 2.add 7 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [3, olor{red}{7}] in it;\\quad 3.add 5 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [3, 7, olor{red}{5}] in it;\\quad 4.add 5 to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence [olor{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;Find the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed.

The elements of this array can be defined as a^{\\rightarrow d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) \\bmod n}, where (i + n - d) \\bmod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n.

Any cave can be reached from any other cave by moving via tunnels.The hero starts the level in cave 1, and every other cave contains a monster.The hero can move between caves via tunnels. If the hero leaves a cave and enters a tunnel, he must finish his movement and arrive at the opposite end of the tunnel.The hero can use each tunnel to move in both directions.

Formally, if the hero has just moved from cave i to cave j via a tunnel, he can not head back to cave i immediately after, but he can head to any other cave connected to cave j with a tunnel.It is known that at least two tunnels come out of every cave, thus, the hero will never find himself in a dead end even considering the above requirement.To pass the level, the hero must beat the monsters in all the caves. When the hero enters a cave for the first time, he will have to fight the monster in it. The hero can beat the monster in cave i if and only if the hero\'s power is strictly greater than a_i.

('permutation-minimization-by-deque', ' Permutation Minimization by Deque', 'In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.A permutation p of size n is given. A permutation of size n is an array of size n in which each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once. For example, [1, 4, 3, 2] and [4, 2, 1, 3] are correct permutations while [1, 2, 4] and [1, 2, 2] are not.Let us consider an empty deque (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [1, 5, 2] currently in the deque, adding an element 4 to the beginning will produce the sequence [olor{red}{4}, 1, 5, 2], and adding same element to the end will produce [1, 5, 2, olor{red}{4}].The elements of the permutation are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with p_1 and finishing with p_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or the end.For example, if we consider a permutation p = [3, 1, 2, 4], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: \\quad 1.add 3 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [olor{red}{3}] in it;\\quad 2.add 1 to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence [olor{red}{1}, 3] in it;\\quad 3.add 2 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [1, 3, olor{red}{2}] in it;\\quad 4.add 4 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [1, 3, 2, olor{red}{4}] in it;Find the lexicographically smallest possible sequence of elements in the deque after the entire permutation has been processed. A sequence [x_1, x_2, ......., x_n] is lexicographically smaller than the sequence [y_1, y_2, ......., y_n] if there exists such i  n that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ......., x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1} and x_i < y_i. In other words, if the sequences x and y have some (possibly empty) matching prefix, and the next element of the sequence x is strictly smaller than the corresponding element of the sequence y. For example, the sequence [1, 3, 2, 4] is smaller than the sequence [1, 3, 4, 2] because after the two matching elements [1, 3] in the start the first sequence has an element 2 which is smaller than the corresponding element 4 in the second sequence.', '1 3 2 4 \n1 2 3 \n1 3 2 \n1 2 \n1 2', '[\"constructive algorithms\",\"greedy\",\"math\"]', 'Medium', '5\n4\n3 1 2 4\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n2\n1 2\n2\n2 1', '5\n4\n3 1 2 4\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n2\n1 2\n2\n2 1', '1 3 2 4 \n1 2 3 \n1 3 2 \n1 2 \n1 2', 'The first line contains an integer t (1  t  1000) — the number of test cases.The next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.

And the i-th ring was either gold or silver. For convenience Saruman wrote down a binary string s of n characters, where the i-th character was 0 if the i-th ring was gold, and 1 if it was silver.Saruman has a magic function f, which takes a binary string and returns a number obtained by converting the string into a binary number and then converting the binary number into a decimal number. For example, f(001010) = 10, f(111) = 7, f(11011101) = 221.Saruman, however, thinks that the order of the rings plays some important role. He wants to find 2 pairs of integers (l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), such that: 1 <= l_1 <= n, 1 <= r_1 <= n, r_1-l_1+1\\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor  1 <= l_2 <= n, 1 <= r_2 <= n, r_2-l_2+1\\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor  Pairs (l_1, r_1) and (l_2, r_2) are distinct.

Then there exists non-negative integer k, such that f(t) = f(w) . k.Here substring s[l:r] denotes s_ls_{l+1}.... s_{r-1}s_r, and \\lfloor x \\rfloor denotes rounding the number down to the nearest integer.Help Saruman solve this problem!

You want to give better places for people with lower sight levels, so for any two people i, j such that a_i < a_j it should be satisfied that s_i < s_j.After you will give seats to all people they will start coming to their seats.

('shifting-sort', 'Shifting Sort', 'The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 ....... n] = [a_1, a_2, ......., a_n].This type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.Technically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions:   You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1  l < r  n) as the boundaries of the segment.  Then you replace the segment a[l ....... r] with it\'s cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. For example, if a = [1, olor{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 ....... 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, olor{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].Sort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments. Note that you don\'t need to minimize the number of cyclic shifts.

The difference between the versions is that the hard version does require you to output the numbers of the rods to be removed. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Stitch likes experimenting with different machines with his friend Sparky. Today they built another machine.The main element of this machine are n rods arranged along one straight line and numbered from 1 to n inclusive. Each of these rods must carry an electric charge quantitatively equal to either 1 or -1 (otherwise the machine will not work). Another condition for this machine to work is that the sign-variable sum of the charge on all rods must be zero.More formally, the rods can be represented as an array of n numbers characterizing the charge: either 1 or -1. Then the condition must hold: a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + .... = 0, or \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i-1} . a_i = 0.Sparky charged all n rods with an electric current, but unfortunately it happened that the rods were not charged correctly (the sign-variable sum of the charge is not zero). The friends decided to leave only some of the rods in the machine. Sparky has q questions. In the ith question Sparky asks: if the machine consisted only of rods with numbers l_i to r_i inclusive, what minimal number of rods could be removed from the machine so that the sign-variable sum of charges on the remaining ones would be zero? Also Sparky wants to know the numbers of these rods. Perhaps the friends got something wrong, and the sign-variable sum is already zero. In that case, you don\'t have to remove the rods at all.If the number of rods is zero, we will assume that the sign-variable sum of charges is zero, that is, we can always remove all rods.Help your friends and answer all of Sparky\'s questions!', '2\n5 8\n2\n1 11\n1\n9\n0\n1\n1\n2\n1 2\n1\n2\n2\n1 3\n1\n2\n2\n2 3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n2\n3 4\n1\n4', '[\"data structures\",\"math\"]', 'Hard', '3\n14 1\n+--++---++-++-\n1 14\n14 3\n+--++---+++---\n1 14\n6 12\n3 10\n4 10\n+-+-\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 3\n3 4\n4 4', '3\n14 1\n+--++---++-++-\n1 14\n14 3\n+--++---+++---\n1 14\n6 12\n3 10\n4 10\n+-+-\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 3\n3 4\n4 4', '2\n5 8\n2\n1 11\n1\n9\n0\n1\n1\n2\n1 2\n1\n2\n2\n1 3\n1\n2\n2\n2 3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n2\n3 4\n1\n4', 'Each test contains multiple test cases.The first line contains one positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), denoting the number of test cases.
