          A premium feature of CodeLab is the availability of canvas in the IDE.
          You can build your logic for the questions on the canvas and code it
          on our very own IDE. You can download your code super easily with a
          single click.

        <div style={style.separateDiv}>
          This project was built for the final Lab Project of our course
          Database Management System. All the knowledge we gathered from the
          lecture of Prof. Pritee Khanna we put into this project. Apart from
          the support and guidance of our head TA Amit Bhati and our project
          guide Shubhangi Chaturvedi this was easier to pull off.
        </div>
        <div style={style.separateDiv}>
          As a team we learned and grew a lot from this project. Our team
          includes Brijmohan Siyag, Devendra Kumar and Sanu Gautam. Our
          collaborative effort led us to this beautiful project.
